I created a chrome extension called url saver. It is used to save urls a person is interested in. They later access the urls and use them as they want.

It includes a json file to configure the app and provide meta data about it.

HOW IT WORKS

1. Visit a website of your choice.
2. The click on the extension.
3. Upon opening, there 2 buttons;
      1. Save Link button - Saves an input from the user
      2. Save Tab button - Will save the current tab
4. Click the button of choice and it saves as per the button clicked.
